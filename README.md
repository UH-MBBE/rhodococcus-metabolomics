# Rhodococcus Metabolomics

This project involves the analysis of metabolomics data obtained from GC-MS and LC-MS experiments, focusing on intracellular and extracellular metabolite profiling. The primary goals are to preprocess the data and perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to identify patterns and differences in metabolite profiles.
